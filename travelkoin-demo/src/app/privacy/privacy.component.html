If you disagree with this Privacy and Cookies Policy, you should discontinue using our services.

    <p><strong>Information we collect from you</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>General information. We receive and store any information you enter on our Website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you (&quot;personal information&quot;), including your full name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, credit card information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request

        </li>
        <li>Companion information. When you make a reservation for someone else through this Website, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You must obtain the consent of other individuals and ensure such other individuals are aware of, understand and accept this Privacy Policy prior to providing us with their personal information and travel
            preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account. We will collect, use and disclose that individual's personal information only for the purpose of making a reservation.
        </li>
        <li>Help Desk calls. Calls to and from our customer service help desk may be recorded or monitored for the purpose of quality control and for staff training. Call recordings will be maintained as long as reasonably necessary and will then be deleted.

        <li>Additional information. We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information.

    </ul>
    <p><strong>How we use your information</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reservations: We use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservation and forward your reservation details to the accommodation you have booked.</li>
        <li>Guest reviews: We use your contact information to invite you by email to write a guest review after your stay. This can help other travelers to choose the accommodation that suits them best.</li>
        <li>Account administration: We offer the Travelkoin User Account facility on our website. We use the information you give us to administer this, allowing you to manage your bookings, take advantage of special offers, make future reservations more easily and manage your personal settings. Managing personal settings allows you to see accommodation that you have searched for before, and see
            other information you have provided about accommodation and destinations. It also allows you to see any reviews you have submitted about places you have stayed in. If you want, you can share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that’s associated with either your own first name or a screen name of your choice. The type of information you can share in
            this way includes your photo, the names of places you have stayed in, your lists, your plans for future trips, your reviews and other information about accommodation and destinations.
        </li>
        <li>Marketing activities: We also use your information for marketing activities, as permitted by law. For example: When you make a reservation with us or set up a user account, we may use your contact information to send you news of similar travel-related products and services. With your consent – if consent is required under local law – we may also send you other regular newsletters by
            email. You can cancel this or unsubscribe from marketing communications at any time using the &quot;Unsubscribe&quot; link in the newsletter, or you can administer your subscriptions through your account (if you've created one). Based on the information you share with us, individualized offers may be shown to you on the Travelkoin website, in mobile apps or on third-party websites,
            including social media sites. These might be offers that you can book directly on the Travelkoin website, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.
        </li>
        <li>Market research: We may sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research. Any additional personal details that you give us as part of the market research will be used only with your consent.</li>
        <li>Fraud detection and prevention: We may use personal data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.</li>
        <li>Improving our services: We use personal data for analytical purposes, to improve our services, to enhance the user experience and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services.</li>
        <li>Customer service: We provide customer service and sharing your details with our customer service staff allows us to respond to any questions you might have about your reservation.</li>
        <li>Other communications: There may be other times when we get in touch by email, by post, by phone or by texting you, depending on the contact information you share with us. This can be for various reasons. Respond to and handle requests you have made. If you have not finalized a reservation online, we may email you a reminder to continue with your reservation without filling out all
            prior reservation details. We may send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Travelkoin. We may also send you other material related to your reservations, such as how to contact Travelkoin, information that might be useful to you in planning your trip or getting the best out of your stay. We may also from time to time provide information about
            the charities that Travelkoin donates to.

    <p><strong>Cookies and other Web technologies</strong></p>
    <p>We automatically collect some information about you and your computer when you visit this Website.

    <p>As a member or visitor to this Website, you will be assigned a permanent cookie file on your computer's hard drive. When you access the Website, reserve or purchase travel, or use selected travel planning tools, we may require you to sign in as a member, using your Member ID and password. Once you sign in as a member, we record the Member ID and the name on the member account in the cookie

We may also record your password in this cookie file as encrypted data if you checked the box entitled &quot;Save this password for automatic sign-in.&quot; Your Member ID, password, and the name on your member account is stored in the cookie file as encrypted data, so no one can view the information it contains by obtaining unauthorized access to your computer.
        Permanent cookie files remain on your computer's hard drive until you manually delete the file.</p>
    <p>In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as flash cookies, on our Website. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our Website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more
        complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this Website, and cannot be accessed by other websites.</p>
    <p>This Website may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our Website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have
        come to our Website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve Website performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our Website. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.</p>
    <p>You may block, delete or disable cookies, Web beacons and other Web technologies by amending your browser or device settings. However, if you do disable these technologies, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features or services on our Website. Disabling these technologies may also mean that you are required to re-enter account information on several occasions during any
        browsing session. For more information, please refer to your browser or device settings.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at our customer care email address shown below.</p>
    <p><strong>Mobile Apps</strong></p>

These apps and mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our website does. When you use a Mobile App, you can choose to allow access to your current location – provided by your mobile device using GPS or similar technologies – in order to
        identify nearby hotels, airports, or other travel service providers. If you choose to allow access, this location data may be collected anonymously as part of search requests logged by our servers. You can switch off the Mobile App’s access to your location at any time through your phone settings menu.</p>
