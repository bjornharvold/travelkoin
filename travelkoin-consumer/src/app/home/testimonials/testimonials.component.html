                    <p>Working in the corporate travel industry my whole career I know the industry's technology challenges too well. Entire verticals of our industry depend on decades old legacy tech and processes, and most of the innovation happening is purely front end. The lack of standards and collaboration between industry players is what's holding back the potential to create a better traveller experience. Travelkoin is an infrastructure project using blockchain technology to fix two of the main pain points, customer loyalty and international payments. By enabling other travel companies to build their own solutions on top of the Travelkoin platform, I believe they have the potential to become a base protocol that the whole industry can benefit from. And its open-source nature will encourage developers from other companies to contribute to the project's development.</p>

                    <p>As a senior executive at Amadeus IT Group, the world’s leading travel technology company, I spent many hours with the key industry players shaping the future of travel. Two common problems of the leading travel brands, are the cost of international payments and the decrease of customer loyalty. As a founder of Xpdite Ventures, I have been on the lookout for startups that
                        solve at least one of these problems. Travelkoin is on a path to solve both!
                        The reason why these problems have not been solved yet, is that the underlying, core technology was not fit for duty. The blockchain however is! By using a stable settlement crypto currency (STU), Travelkoin will make international payments cheaper and faster for the travel industry and through the usage of the TKT reward token for all travel related activities, allow
                        travellers to truly reap the benefits of a loyalty program.</p>

                    <p>Payments are a huge problem in hospitality due to its international landscape. Fixing this will have tremendous value for all parties - productivity, bottom line impact and efficiencies. Travelkoin's vision is on the right track.
                        Loyalty has been broken since years with most people never reaching the point of benefit. Travelkoin's fresh approach to loyalty will not only revolutionize but unify the industry; a loyalty marketplace that will benefit the consumer, the suppliers, the providers - all from the moment they connect.</p>

The success of a company is based on effective management, which in today's world can be regarded as strategic decision making and cost-control. Travelotto is an Online Travel Agency that integrates 6 different travel suppliers under one platform. We needed a system that is reliable, cost-effective and automated. And that's when we heard about Travelkoin. With the ability to effortlessly process micro-payments, Travelkoin has blessed us with a dream solution that saves time and money via self-executing smart contracts and blockchain technology. Travelkoin's loyalty program is at the next level of innovation which eliminates the negatives of a traditional points system and integrates a user-oriented approach, hence rewarding them with tokens that appreciate in value.</p>
