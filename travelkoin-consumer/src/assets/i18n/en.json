      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY": "Payment Gateway",
      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY_1": "Travel suppliers are particularly prone to having to pay excessive transaction fees because their industry is particularly fragmented and, more often than not, require multiple cross-border transactions. It also means payments often take time to process and travel suppliers have to guarantee payments up to 45 days in advance. The only way to currently make transaction fees go down is to process more transactions and receive a bulk discount from the payment provider.",
      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY_2": "puts an end to the complexity and cost of doing business in the travel eco-system. Payments are immediate and suppliers can deal directly with their counter-party without the need for a costly middle man. This is made possible by the blockchain and our custom made smart contracts for travel suppliers. Watch the video about blockchain made by Sloan's School of business at MIT.",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM": "Loyalty platform",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM_1": "Almost everyone in the travel industry use a membership rewards program to acquire and retain customers. Customers are locked into programs that offer little or no incentive to stay except for being penalized if they don't keep on racking up points. A loyalty program should be mutually beneficial and fun!",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM_2": "offers a loyalty platform quite like no other. It works as well for B2C as it does for B2B. The benefits to its users are many: It can be converted to fiat currency at any time. If you have earned Travelkoin tokens, they never expire. Travelkoins are only generated when a travel related action occurs, such as a booking. A travel supplier wants these tokens from their customers so they can use them to get free services on the Travelkoin Platform. That way travel suppliers will be competing between themselves to acquire customers and customer satisfaction goes through the roof. Finally, the token can easily be white labelled allowing larger suppliers with existing programs to easily switch.",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS": "Stable settlements",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS_1": "Stability is the most important feature of global economies to be successful. Without stability, individuals across the world could not have foreseeable costs while engaging in commerce and savings allowing them to make reasonable decisions. And with this stability and predictability and fungibility in mind, Travelkoinâ€™s STU was designed: as an attempt to bring stability and better business planning to the world of crypto currency and to the world of travel and to all individuals who use the Travelkoin network.",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS_2": "STUs are created by a mechanism similar to convertible notes, which are often used to fund start-ups. In the startup scene, convertible notes are short-term debt instruments that can be converted to ownership at a rate determined in the future, typically during future funding rounds. A blockchain based token, like Travelkoin, can be considered as ownership in the community whereas a convertible note, like STU, can be viewed as a debt denominated in any other commodity or currency. The terms of the convertible note allow the holder to convert to the backing value with a minimum notice at the fair market price."
