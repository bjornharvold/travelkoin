      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY": "Payment Gateway",
      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY_1": "Travel suppliers are particularly prone to having to pay excessive transaction fees because their industry is particularly fragmented and, more often than not, require multiple cross-border transactions. It also means payments often take time to process and travel suppliers have to guarantee payments up to 45 days in advance. The only way to currently make transaction fees go down is to process more transactions and receive a bulk discount from the payment provider.",
      "PAYMENT_GATEWAY_2": "puts an end to the complexity and cost of doing business in the travel eco-system. Payments are immediate and suppliers can deal directly with their counter-party without the need for a costly middle man. This is made possible by the blockchain and our custom made smart contracts for travel suppliers. Watch the video about blockchain made by Sloan's School of business at MIT.",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM": "Loyalty platform",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM_1": "Almost everyone in the travel industry use a membership rewards program to acquire and retain customers. Customers are locked into programs that offer little or no incentive to stay except for being penalized if they don't keep on racking up points. A loyalty program should be mutually beneficial and fun!",
      "LOYALTY_PLATFORM_2": "offers a loyalty platform quite like no other. It works as well for B2C as it does for B2B. The benefits to its users are many: It can be converted to fiat currency at any time. If you have earned Travelkoin tokens, they never expire. Travelkoins are only generated when a travel related action occurs, such as a booking. A travel supplier wants these tokens from their customers so they can use them to get free services on the Travelkoin Platform. That way travel suppliers will be competing between themselves to acquire customers and customer satisfaction goes through the roof. Finally, the token can easily be white labelled allowing larger suppliers with existing programs to easily switch.",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS": "Stable settlements",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS_1": "Stability is the most important feature of global economies to be successful. Without stability, individuals across the world could not have foreseeable costs while engaging in commerce and savings allowing them to make reasonable decisions. And with this stability and predictability and fungibility in mind, Travelkoinâ€™s STU was designed: as an attempt to bring stability and better business planning to the world of crypto currency and to the world of travel and to all individuals who use the Travelkoin network.",
      "STABLE_SETTLEMENTS_2": "STUs are created by a mechanism similar to convertible notes, which are often used to fund start-ups. In the startup scene, convertible notes are short-term debt instruments that can be converted to ownership at a rate determined in the future, typically during future funding rounds. A blockchain based token, like Travelkoin, can be considered as ownership in the community whereas a convertible note, like STU, can be viewed as a debt denominated in any other commodity or currency. The terms of the convertible note allow the holder to convert to the backing value with a minimum notice at the fair market price."

      "QUESTION": "Why should I invest? / Why will the value of the TKT token increase?",
      "ANSWER": "The TKT token is the \"gas\" that powers all the services on our platform. Our two first applications will be a payment gateway and a white-labeled loyalty program. When an airline, hotel or any other travel tech company use these services and run out of tokens, they need to buy more. As we add more services and as global travel increases, the demand for tokens goes up. Travelers earn tokens; they receive tokens when adding value to the platform such as making a booking. Users can convince travelers to depart with their tokens in return for a good deal. But, there won't be enough travelers for everyone so there will be a need to purchase tokens to run our service. Our token will always increase in value as long as we offer up great services to our travel tech partners and global travel steadily increases."

      "QUESTION": "Can anyone participate?",
      "ANSWER": "We expect each investor to know all applicable laws governing an ICO in his or her country. The Travelkoin team does KYC (Know Your Customer) upon registration but we do not limit participation. Investors, especially from the U.S., the People's Republic of China and South Korea, need to check their current limitations imposed upon them by their respective governments before participating in our ICO."

      "QUESTION": "Roger Ver: How is Travelkoin going to peg STU to a basket of fiat currencies? Will it be backed by fiat in an auditable account somewhere? If yes, how are you going to hedge again forex risk if you allow holders of STU to cash out into their local fiat at a pegged rate?",
      "ANSWER": "Our original idea was to peg STU to a currency basket similar to Special Drawing Right (SDR) of IMF. However, discussions with early backers showed that this is not really desirable as most cross-border transactions in the travel industry involve just an origin and a destination currency, so pegging against a whole basket doesn't add any benefit. It makes more sense to tokenize the origin currencies, starting with USD, EUR, CNY, JPY. Despite the bad rap of Tether (USDT), we believe that 100% collateralization is the best way to provide stability. So each of the tokenized currencies would be held in an auditable bank account. The tokenization does not eliminate forex risk. As in traditional settlements the risk remains with the counterparties involved based on the contracts they have with each other. We plan to create a STU token per fiat currency and the exchange rate should be determined between the counterparties, or left dynamic if that is what they agree on. Travelkoin basically holds the fiat as collateral until the point that the token holder wants to convert their token back into fiat. We would not want the STU traded on a public exchange as it will be near impossible to guarantee the required stability then. If for some reason a lot more companies buy STU in USD and send them as payment to Europe where they are converted into fiat EUR, then Travelkoin would have to make the necessary transfer of fiat USD to EUR to provide liquidity in the EUR market. It might be of advantage to the paying party to use the designated destination currency STU if that seems more beneficial to them. As mentioned before, counterparties still have the responsibility to assess their forex exposure and risk. But STU gives them some options."

      "QUESTION": "Why don't you offer a pre-sale, bonus structure or other discounts?",
      "ANSWER": "We want to offer the blockchain community and our investors with a completely egalitarian investment vehicle. We know the Travelkoin platform will be a massive success and help usher travel tech into the 21st century. We don't require silly amounts of capital and we know the pain points of our travel tech partners and those of our own. Offering up discounts doesn't make sense to us. We might consider taking on a strategic private investor before the ICO starts. That entity will receive a slightly discounted price and we will have ourselves an early strategic partner."

    "5": {
      "QUESTION": "How will you create demand?",
      "ANSWER": "Our undertaking is, first and foremost, a B2B integration story. A majority of the funds will go here. Travel tech companies will learn to do business on our new platform for free. The demand for our payment gateway is already overwhelming. The platform starts selling itself once we can gamify the experience through the use of the loyalty platform. Everyone will feel the NEED to be on board."

      "QUESTION": "What is the legal entity behind this ICO?",
      "ANSWER": "Our legal entity is a Thai based limited liability company called \"The Blockchain Company Ltd.\" (Reg: 0105561011251) 180 Sixteen Place Building, B Zone, 2nd Floor, Soi Sukhumvit 16 (Sammitr), Klongtoey, Bangkok 10110, Thailand. Phone: +66 (0) 85-489-1301."
