    <p><strong>Travelkoin Terms of Use v1.1</strong></p>
    <p>Last updated: May 2017</p>
    <p><strong>1. </strong><strong> Introduction</strong></p>
    <p>Travelkoin provides a blockchain platform for travel suppliers and their customers on its website (the “Site).</p>
    <p>References to the Site are deemed to include derivatives thereof, including but not necessarily limited to mobile websites and
        applications. The Terms of Use –as defined below- apply to our services, directly or indirectly made available to you through whatever means, including online reservations, customer service requests or otherwise. By accessing, browsing and using the Site and/or by making a reservation through Travelkoin, you acknowledge having read, understood and agreed to the Terms of Use. Our different
        policies and guidelines, which can be found throughout the Site, including but not limited to, the Privacy Statement, Guest review Policy, FAQs (collectively the “Policies”), should be read in conjunction with and are an integral part of these terms and conditions and are hereby included by reference. The terms and conditions set out below and the Policies are collectively referred to as
        the
        “Terms of Use”. If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please cease use of the Site immediately. By continuing to use the Site, you are deemed to agree with the Terms of Use. The Terms of Use – as may be amended from time to time – constitute the entire agreement, and supersede any other agreements or understandings (oral or written), between you and us with respect to their subject
        matters
        unless explicitly stated otherwise.</p>
    <p><strong>2. </strong><strong>Scope of Services. </strong></p>
    <p>Through the Site Travelkoin provides an online platform through which non-commercial users can view and book all types of temporary accommodation (for example, hotels, motels, hostels and bed &amp; breakfasts, collectively the &quot;Accommodation(s)&quot;), offered by the providers of the
        Accommodations (the “Accommodation Providers”) can advertise their rooms for reservation, and through which visitors to the Site can make such reservations. By making a reservation through the Site, you enter into a legally binding contractual relationship directly with the Accommodation Provider chosen by you. From the point at which you make your reservation, we act solely as an
        intermediary
        between you and your chosen Accommodation Provider, transmitting the details of your reservation to that Accommodation Provider and sending you a confirmation email for and on behalf of that Accommodation Provider.</p>
    <p>When rendering our services, the information that we disclose about Accommodations is based on the information provided to us by the relevant Accommodation Provider. As such,
        the Accommodation Providers are given access to an extranet through which they are fully responsible for updating all rates, availability and other information pertaining to their Accommodations (the “Accommodations Information”) which are displayed on our website. Although we will use reasonable skill and care in performing our services we will not verify if, and cannot guarantee that,
        the
        Accommodations Information is accurate, complete or correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any (temporary and/or partial) breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our website or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading or untrue information or non-delivery of information. Each Accommodation
        Provider
        remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness and correctness of the (descriptive) information (including the rates and availability) displayed on the Site. Neither the Site nor Travelkoin make any recommendations or endorsements of the quality, service level, qualification or (star) rating of any Accommodations or any Accommodation Provider.
    </p>
    <p>Our services are made available for personal and non-commercial use only. Therefore, you are not allowed to re-sell, deep-link, use, copy, monitor (e.g. spider, scrape), display, download or reproduce any content or information, software, products or services available on our website for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p>
    <p>The Site does not constitute and should not be
        regarded as a recommendation or endorsement of (the quality, service level or rating of) any Accommodation listed on the Site. We hereby expressly disclaim any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the quality, status or adequacy of any Accommodation listed on the Site. The Accommodations can be ranked on the Site according to different criteria (star rating, reviews,
        etc.).
        The default ranking is based on an automated algorithm which may be updated or amended by Travelkoin or our authorized representatives from time to time.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right not to accept customers or bookings (or in exceptional cases to cancel confirmed ones) at our sole and absolute discretion and for whatever reason without the need to justify such refusal or cancellation. If your
        booking is rejected or cancelled by Travelkoin and after you have made payment, you will receive a refund of the total booking value. We also reserve the right to bar (“blacklist”) users from the Site, on a permanent or temporary basis, at our sole and absolute discretion. Any such blacklisted user must not attempt to use the Site under any other name or through any other user. See also
        below
        for our fraud prevention mechanisms.</p>
    <p>In rare cases, we may also have to cancel or reject a booking due to “obvious errors”, independent of the origin of such errors. For clarity, an obvious error is a mistake on the Site (e.g. in terms of price) which a reasonable person would not consider to be normal. The amount charged will be reimbursed without charge in such case. Whether to cancel
        or reject a booking for this reason is in Travelkoin’s sole discretion. Please note that suspected group bookings can also be rejected or cancelled by Travelkoin or the Accommodation as most Accommodations have specific procedures for group bookings</p>
    <p>It is your responsibility to let the Accommodation Provider know any special requests or requirements you have at check-in. Circumstances such
        as ongoing renovations, Accommodation booking errors, and specific guest needs can affect the quality of your stay.</p>
    <p>The Accommodation star ratings are provided for your information only. A star rating is only indicative of the level of comfort you can expect to find in a particular Accommodation, with a higher star rating generally, but not always, being indicative of a higher level of
        comfort and amenities. The star ratings are based on information we have received from our suppliers, including the Accommodations and we do not independently verify star ratings. Please note that star ratings can vary greatly on the basis of location, subjective differences in taste, local market conditions and practices and star ratings in different countries may not be comparable.</p>
    <p>Our
        services are made for personal use only and commercial use of our Site is not permitted. You are not allowed to resell, deep-link, mirror or frame, copy, monitor, display, download, reproduce or make use in any way any content or information, software, products and/or services available on our Site for any commercial or competitive activity or purpose.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Additional Charges,
        Prices and Best Price Guarantee</strong></p>
    <p>Additional Charges by Accommodations</p>
    <p>Please note that all prices on the Site are for your Accommodation room reservation and for the requested stay dates and for the number of people indicated, unless indicated otherwise. Breakfast is typically not included unless explicitly stated otherwise. Charges and taxes that are required to be
        collected directly from guests, are typically not included in the rate unless stated otherwise. These include but are not limited to facility fees, transport, food, drink, etc. The Accommodation may refuse to accept additional persons if not duly informed in advance. Please check the “Accommodation Information”, “Booking Conditions”, “Cancellation Policy” or the Site. When in doubt whether
        something is included, you can contact our Customer Service team at <a href="mailto:info@travelkoin.io">info@travelkoin.io</a>.</p>
    <p>Prices and Best Price Guarantee</p>
    <p>The rates on our Site are very competitive and we aim to get you the lowest rate available. All prices on <a href="http://travelkoin.io">Travelkoin.com</a> are per room for your entire stay and include VAT and
        all other taxes, unless stated differently on our website or confirming email.</p>
    <p>Should you find your Accommodation room reservation, with the same booking conditions, at a lower rate on the Internet after you have made a booking through us, we will match the difference between our rate and the lower rate under the terms and conditions of the Best Price Guarantee. For a claim to be valid
        under this guarantee, it must satisfy and be submitted in compliance with all relevant terms and conditions of our Best Price guarantee. Sometimes cheaper rates are available on the Site for a specific stay at an Accommodation for the same room type, however, these rates made by Accommodations may carry special restrictions and conditions, for example in respect of cancellation and refund
        policies. Please check the room type and rate details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation. The same room type may have different rates, depending on such restrictions and conditions.</p>
    <p>Currency Conversion</p>
    <p>Rates can be converted into different currencies for your convenience. The currency converter is for your information only and the actual price will
        be charged in the currency charged by the Accommodation provider.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Privacy</strong></p>
    <p>We respect your privacy. Please have a look at our Privacy Statement for further information.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Credit card or bank transfer and age</strong></p>
    <p>Certain Accommodation Providers may, in line with their relevant payment policies, offer users of the Site the opportunity to
        pay for their reservations (wholly or partly) by means of secure online payment, to the extent that such online payment is offered by the bank of such user. Payment is processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the Accommodation Provider.</p>
    <p>For certain rates or special offers like non-refundable deals, Accommodation Providers may require that payment is
        made at the time of booking by credit card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorized or charged, sometimes without any option for refund, upon making the reservation. Please check the room details for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.</p>
    <p>In the event of credit card fraud or unauthorized use of your credit card by third parties, some banks and/or credit card
        companies may bear the risk and cover all or part of the charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which may sometimes be subject to a deductible. In the event that you are charged the deductible by your credit card company and/or as a result of unauthorized transactions resulting from a reservation made on the Site, we will pay you this deductible, subject to an aggregate limit of USD
        45
        (or the equivalent in your local currency). Payment of the deductible by us is conditional upon you reporting this fraud to your credit card provider and/or bank (in strict accordance with its reporting rules and procedures) and contacting us immediately by email (customerdesk@<a href="http://traveliko.com">traveliko.com</a>). Please state 'credit card fraud' in the subject line of your
        email
        and provide us with evidence of the charged deductible (e.g. policy of the credit card company). This indemnification only applies to credit card reservations made using Travelkoin's secure server and the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through our default or negligence and through no fault of your own while using the secure server.</p>
    <p><strong>6. Age</strong></p>
    <p>In order to
        make a booking you must be over 18 years old, or the age of majority in those countries and territories where it is higher than 18, and have the full legal capacity to make the transaction, or have the authorization from your legal guardian. You undertake that the credit or debit card you are using is your own or that you are authorized by the holder of that credit or debit card to
        complete
        the booking with this card and that there are sufficient funds to cover the cost of the transaction. You accept financial responsibility for all transactions made under your name or account.</p>
    <p><strong>7. Cancellation and no show</strong></p>
    <p>By making a reservation with any Accommodation Provider, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Accommodation
        Provider, and to any additional terms and conditions of that Accommodation Provider that may apply to your reservation or during your stay, including for services rendered and/or products offered by that Accommodation Provider. The delivery terms and conditions of any Accommodation Provider can be obtained from the relevant Accommodation Provider. The general cancellation and no-show
        policy of
        each Accommodation provider is made available on the Site on the accommodation information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email. Certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or change. Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Accommodation Provider in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation. It is your
        responsibility
        to check the room details carefully for cancellation and refund conditions prior to making your reservation. In case a reservation which requires down payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment cannot be collected in full for the relevant (remaining) amount(s) on the payment date, in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the accommodation, the reservation may be cancelled without a
        prior notice of default or warning. Wrong debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards, late payment, wrong bank or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any (non-refundable) prepaid amount unless the Accommodation Provider agrees or allows otherwise under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>
    <p>If you wish to
        review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email in respect of that reservation and follow the instructions therein. Please note that you may be charged for any cancellation or adjustment of your reservation in accordance with the Accommodation Provider's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid
        amount.
        It is your duty to read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the Accommodation Provider before making your reservation and remember to make such further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.</p>

        these terms and conditions and to the extent permitted by law, we shall only be liable for direct damages actually suffered, paid or incurred by you due to an attributable shortcoming of our obligations in respect to our services up to an aggregate amount of the lesser of the aggregate cost of your reservation as set out in the confirmation email or two hundred United States dollars (or

    <p>Whether the accommodation you stay at charges you (or has charged you)
        for your room, or we are facilitating the payment of the room price, you agree and acknowledge that the accommodation is at all times responsible for the collection, withholding, remittance and payment of the applicable taxes due on the total amount of the room price to the relevant tax authorities.

        Use.</p>
    <p>Failure by us to enforce a right does not result in waiver of such right. You may not assign or transfer your rights. The Terms of Use can be amended at any time by posting the latest version on the Site. Any posted variation of the Terms of Use will supersede all previous versions.</p>
